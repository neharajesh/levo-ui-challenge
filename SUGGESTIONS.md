## Suggestions

1. Used own dummy data since the number of requests for mockapi were reached. Since dummy data was used locally and I could not fetch data from an API, I have used manually filtered data in some places.
2. Would have loved to set things up from scratch, so I could include eslint rules to make the code cleaner. Non-CRA code would have allowed for cleaner imports. A React based framework like NextJS would have allowed for cleaner routing and folder structure as well. 
3. Handling data with context could have been done in a better way - I'm currently using a single context since we are only handling three data states in my solution. On a larger scale, using multiple contexts and reducers would be a better solution.
4. Accessibility and performance could be made better.
