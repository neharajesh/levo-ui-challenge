## Solution

Exercise was completed using - React, Typescript and Contexts.
Did not use any CSS framework.

1. Used a simple folder structure to enable clean code. 
2. Used separate files to maintain exports. 
3. Used functional components as much as possible. 


### Improvements 

1. Need to implement the context structure in a better way.
